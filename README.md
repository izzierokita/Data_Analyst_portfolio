# Data_Analyst_portfolio

After 5 years of working as a Digital Marketing Specialist, I decided that I want to set a more targeted approach and become a Data Analyst. I believe that it is more an evolution, than a revolution for me because I was always very into numbers.

What marketing taught me, is that you should always set yourself a goal that you can measure. I love retrieving and analyzing data from Google Analytics, Hubspot, or Google Search Console. I'm determined to expand my analytical skills further, delivering valuable business insights.

Where I shine the most is the technology sector. My dream job is joining a Software as a Service product company and bringing up my unique point of view on board!

**Inside this repository I store the projects showcasing my technical and analytical skills, which I could bring to my new workplace.**
